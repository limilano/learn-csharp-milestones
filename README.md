#### Notes...

- **RTM** - Sometimes I give the command you need and sometimes you have to read the documentation to find it.
- **Details** - Following the instructions, especially those with a ‚úèÔ∏è
- **Reference** - If you get stuck compare your code with the book [source code](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learning-C-8-by-Developing-Games-with-Unity-2020)






## Chapter 1
Getting to Know Your Environment (9‚Äì21)

- [x] Open the reference manual for any component from inside Unity. Paste the link: **file:///C:/Program%20Files/Unity/Hub/Editor/2020.3.26f1/Editor/Data/Documentation/en/Manual/class-AudioListener.html**
- [x] Find the button to jump to the scripting reference the any reference manual page. Paste the link: **file:///C:/Program%20Files/Unity/Hub/Editor/2020.3.26f1/Editor/Data/Documentation/en/ScriptReference/AudioListener.html**
- [x] Search for the `Strings` class in [Microsoft's C# documents](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/). Paste the link: **https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/strings/**


## Chapter 2
The Building Blocks of Programming (22‚Äì37)

## Chapter 3
Diving into Variables, Types, and Methods (38‚Äì64)

- [x] Update Assets/Scripts/LearningCurve.cs
	- [x] Variables
		- [x] Use access modifiers to make your variables explicitly `public` and `private`

	- [x] Methods
		- [x] Define a simple method with parameters
		- [x] Add a return type and return some data from a method  
		- [x] Use data returned from a method  
- [x] Explain some differences between public and private variables: **Public variables can be edited outside of the class by other classes and private variable need accessors to be changed outside of the class. Ex: if you were making a banking app and your class' balance was public it could be changed in the main function and you could have like -$10000 but if it was private you could create functions that prevent it from being accessed subtracting so much money it's negative etc...**


## Chapter 4

		- [x] Write an Array of the type `int[]`
		- [x] Write a List of the type `List<string>`
		- [x] Write a Dictionary of the type `Dictionary<string, int>`
	- [x] Loops
		- [x] Use a `for` loop to print a specific index of a `List<string>`
		- [x] Use a `foreach` loop to print all indexes of a `List<string>`
		- [x] Use a `foreach` loop to print the `KeyValuePair.Key` and `KeyValuePair.Value` of all indexes of a `Dictionary<string, int>`



## Chapter 5
Working with Classes, Structs, and OOP (94‚Äì119)

- Classes
	- [ ] ‚úèÔ∏è Explain the difference between reference and value type variables: **Reference types hold the address for the information and value types hold the actual value (Nodes in LinkedLists are the best example because they contain a .value which is the value and a .next which is the reference/address to the next value is in the list so you can see the difference in the 2 types of information being stored)**

	- [ ] ‚úèÔ∏è Q: Will a [collision detection](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CollidersOverview.html) occur when a Kinematic Rigidbody Collider touches a Static Collider? : **??**
	- [ ] Use `OnCollisionEnter()` to check if a game object has run into another collider
	- [ ] Use `Destroy()` to remove a game object from the scene
